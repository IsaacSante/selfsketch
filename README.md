Hey so the grahphics on the sculptures are all from instagram data. 
I wanted to a make a zine or posters for diffrent sculptures using the data and other grahic elements. 

Im not trying to say anything explicit expct explore how 3d,2d and data can come together, a lot of the comments i give and recive on instagram are about graphic design and just wanted to capture that vibe. 


What would you change ? Are the sculptures too repetive or like maybe use diffrent data. 
Do you like it? Do you think some parts are bad or is it tacky. 
If I countined this a series would you check out some more. 
Any feedback is welcomed.
