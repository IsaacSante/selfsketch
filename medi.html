      I see that each page loads a different stylesheet. However, the individual stylesheets have a lot of repetition in terms of the
      css properties that are applied there. I suggest you manage all of your project's styles in one css file. This way you can
      define common styles once (which means you can change them in one place when you want to change your design).
      For the styles that are different on each page, you can apply a class name on <body> or another outer div that wraps all of your content.
      Then, you can apply page-specific things by selecting with this class name. You can also give element-specific class names and style accordingly.
      This method of managing the styles helps in thinking about your whole project as having one design system.
